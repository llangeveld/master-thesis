The aim of this Agreement is : ( a ) to promote through the expansion of reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway and thus to foster in the Community and in Norway the advance of economic activity , the improvement of living and employment conditions , and increased productivity and financial stability ,

( c ) to contribute in this way , by the removal of barriers to trade , to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade .

( ii ) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party ;
the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 27 .

The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee , particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit .

( b ) As regards Article 24 , the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee , which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties .
If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred , the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported .
The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein .
( c ) As regards Article 25 , consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures .
( d ) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible , the Contracting Party concerned may , in the situations specified in Articles 24 , 25 and 26 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade , apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation .
Where one or more Member States of the Community or Norway is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments , the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures .
It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith .
For this purpose , it shall make recommendations and take decisions in the cases provided for in the Agreement .

( 2 ) Sofern das Carnet gemäß Absatz 1 bis spätestens zum letzten Gültigkeitstag von der Abgangszollstelle angenommen worden ist , bleibt es bis zur Beendigung des TIR-Transports bei der Bestimmungszollstelle gültig . Provided that it has been accepted by the customs office of departure on or before the final date of validity as provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article , the carnet shall remain valid until the termination of the TIR operation at the customs office of destination .
These facts shall be clearly indicated in the TIR carnet .

Nevertheless , Contracting Parties shall avoid delaying traffic when the defects found are of minor importance and do not involve any risk of smuggling .
( b ) Procedure for transport under cover of a TIR carnet
No guarantee shall be required for the road vehicle or combination of vehicles or container .
When a road vehicle or combination of vehicles is carrying out a TIR operation , one rectangular plate bearing the inscription " TIR " and conforming to the specifications given in Annex 5 to this Convention shall be affixed to the front and another to the rear of the road vehicle or combination of vehicles .
These plates shall be so placed as to be clearly visible and shall be removable .
However , a single TIR carnet may be made out in respect of a combination of vehicles or for several containers loaded on to a single road vehicle or on to a combination of vehicles .
In that case the TIR manifest of the goods covered by the TIR carnet shall list separately the content of each vehicle in the combination of vehicles or of each container .
It shall contain at least the number of detachable vouchers for customs acceptance and for discharge which are necessary for the transport operation in question .
A TIR operation may involve several customs offices of departure and destination , but , save as may otherwise be authorized by the Contracting Party or Parties concerned : ( a ) the customs offices of departure shall be situated in only one country ;
( b ) the customs offices of destination shall be situated in not more than two countries ;
( c ) the total number of customs offices of departure and destination shall not exceed four .
The goods and the road vehicle , the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced with the TIR carnet at the customs office of departure .
The customs authorities of the country of departure shall take such measures as are necessary for satisfying themselves as to the accuracy of the goods manifest and / or for affixing the customs seals or for checking customs seals affixed under the responsibility of the said customs authorities by duly authorized persons .
For journeys in the territory of their country , the customs authorities may fix a time limit and require the road vehicle , the combination of vehicles or the container to follow a prescribed route .
At each customs office en route and at customs offices of destination , the road vehicle , the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced for purposes of control to the customs authorities together with the load and the TIR carnet relating thereto .
( 1 ) Die Durchgangszollstellen jeder Vertragspartei anerkennen in der Regel die von den Zollbehörden der anderen Vertragsparteien angelegten unverletzten Zollverschlüsse , es sei denn , daß eine Beschau der Waren nach Artikel 5 Absatz 2 vorgenommen wird . As a general rule and except when they examine the goods in accordance with Article 5 ( 2 ) , the customs authorities of the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals of other Contracting Parties , provided that they are intact .
The said customs authorities may , however , if control requirements make it necessary , add their own seals .
( 2 ) Die von einer Vertragspartei so anerkannten Zollverschlüsse genießen in ihrem Gebiet den gleichen Rechtsschutz wie die nationalen Zollverschlüsse . The customs seals thus accepted by a Contracting Party shall have in the territory of that Contracting Party the benefit of the same legal protection as is accorded to the national seals .
The customs authorities shall not , except in special cases : - require road vehicles , combinations of vehicles or containers to be escorted at the carriers ' expense on the territory of their country ,
- require examination en route of road vehicles , combinations of vehicles or containers and their loads .
If the customs authorities conduct an examination of the load of a road vehicle , combination of vehicles or container in the course of the journey or at a customs office en route , they shall record on the TIR carnet vouchers used in their country , on the corresponding counterfoils , and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet , particulars of the new seals affixed and of the controls carried out .
If the customs seals are broken en route otherwise than in the circumstances of Articles 24 and 35 , or if any goods are destroyed or damaged without breaking of such seals , the procedure laid down in Annex 1 to this Convention for the use of the TIR carnet shall , without prejudice to the possible application of the provisions of national law , be followed , and the certified report in the TIR carnet shall be completed .
In that case , the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the journey continues shall accept the TIR carnet for the resumption of the TIR operation , provided that the customs seals and / or identifying marks have remained intact .
( 2 ) Das gleiche gilt für den Teil der Strecke , auf dem der Inhaber des Carnet TIR im Gebiet einer Vertragspartei das Carnet nicht verwendet , weil sich einfachere Verfahren für den Zollgutversand anbieten oder die Inanspruchnahme eines solchen Verfahrens nicht erforderlich ist . The same shall apply where for a part of the journey the TIR carnet is not used by the holder of the carnet in the territory of a Contracting Party because of the existence of simpler customs transit procedures or when the use of a customs transit regime is not necessary .
Subject to the provisions of this Convention , and in particular Article 18 , another customs office of destination may he substituted for a customs office of destination originally indicated .
On arrival of the load at the customs office of destination , and provided that the goods are then placed under another system of customs control or are cleared for home use , discharge of the TIR carnet shall take place without delay .
( c ) Provisions concerning transport of heavy or bulky goods
( 1 ) Dieser Abschnitt gilt nur für den Transport von aussergewöhnlich schweren oder sperrigen Waren im Sinne des Artikels 1 Buchstabe k ) . The provisions of this section apply only to the transport of heavy or bulky goods as defined in Article 1 ( k ) of this Convention .
All the provisions of this Convention , save those to which the special provisions of this section make an exception , shall apply to the transport of heavy or bulky goods under the TIR procedure .
The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet , but also any goods which , though not enumerated in the carnet , are on the load platform or among the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet .
The cover and all vouchers of the TIR carnet shall bear the endorsement " heavy or bulky goods " in hold letters in English or in French .
The authorities at the customs office of departure may require such packing lists , photographs , drawings , etc . , as are necessary for the identification of the goods carried to be appended to the TIR carnet .
In this case they shall endorse these documents , one copy of the said documents shall be attached to the inside of the cover page of the TIR carnet , and all the manifests of the TIR carnet shall include a reference to such documents .
The authorities at the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals and / or identifying marks affixed by the competent authorities of other Contracting Parties .

WHEREAS : ( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the Special Action Programme decided at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual low-income countries facing general problems of transfer of resources hampering their development ;
( b ) In order to implement the abovementioned decision the EEC has requested the Association to administer for them a special account ( Special Action Account ) in the aggregate amount of the equivalent of 385 million dollars , to be kept separate and apart from all other accounts and assets of the Association and to be used for credits ( Special Action Credits ) in amounts which will be additional , in respect of both programme and project lending , to the amount of the Association 's planned programme for the period of commitment of the Special Action Account for each country eligible to receive them and otherwise on the basis set forth below ;
( c ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States , and the Association shall use its best efforts to assure , that the entire amount to be contributed by the Member States be committed within six months from the effective date of the Agreement and disbursed on credits as far as possible within two years from the effective date ;
( d ) The EEC and the Association have consulted regarding the proposed implementation and administration of this Agreement and the commitment of funds to assure a broad and balanced geographical distribution thereunder .
To that end the Association has furnished the EEC with a table showing the manner in which it would propose to apply the criteria set forth in this Agreement ;
There is hereby established by the Association a special account entitled " Special Action Account " constituted by the monies which the Member States shall contribute to the Special Action Account in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement which shall be held in trust and used by the Association , acting as administrator ( the Association acting in that capacity is hereinafter referred to as the administrator ) only for the purpose of , and in accordance with , the provisions of this Agreement .
The Special Action Account shall be kept separate and apart from all other accounts and assets of the Association .
Each Member State shall make a contribution to the Special Action Account in an amount in its own currency equivalent as of the date of signature of this Agreement to the United States dollar amount specified below opposite its name . > PIC FILE = " T0019538 " >
Payment of each contribution shall be made as follows : ( a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest bearing notes of the Member State payable on demand in its currency and to the order of the Association , as administrator of the Special Action Account , and deposited in the depository of the Association in the country concerned .
( b ) Payment shall be made in two instalments : ( i ) the first , consisting of at least 45 % of each contribution , shall be made within 30 days after the effective date of this Agreement , or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator ;
( ii ) the second , consisting of the balance of the contribution , shall be made by 1 January 1979 or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking account of the time necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budgets .
( c ) Any Member State which so wishes may make its payments more rapidly than as indicated above .
The administrator shall draw on the cash or notes on an approximately pro rata basis in accordance with the Association 's normal procedures in order to meet disbursements of Special Action Credits and to maintain a reasonable working balance in the Special Action Account .
All amounts credited to the Special Action Account shall , in accordance with the EEC 's requirements , be used by the administrator exclusively for the purpose of making Special Action Credits to low-income member countries of the Association with immediate needs , in particular among the least developed ( 1 ) and the most seriously affected ( 1 ) of the developing countries , whose prospects for development have been seriously curtailed by external factors and which are faced with general problems connected with the transfer of resources and which may , as a result thereof , be faced with debt service difficulties .
In making such credits , the administrator shall , in accordance with the EEC 's requirements , be guided by the following factors : ( i ) the relative poverty of the developing country concerned and its long-term growth potential ;
( ii ) the extent to which the country concerned depends on official development assistance for its external capital resources ;
( iii ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and prospective economic problems of the country ;
( iv ) developments in and prospects for the country 's export earnings ;
( v ) the capacity of the country to import goods essential to the development process ;
( vi ) the composition and the trend of the debt service obligations of the country and its capacity for any further borrowing upon non-concessional terms ; and
( vii ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are likely to be met by contributions from other sources .
Each Special Action Credit shall be made for the purpose of financing a clearly identifiable , quick-disbursing development programme or project ( including a sector project ) which , whether or not it is included in the Association 's own lending programme , shall be appraised , approved and administered in accordance with the procedures and practices applicable to development credits made out of the Association 's regular resources , taking account of the objective of additionality referred to in paragraph ( b ) of the preamble to this Agreement .
The resources of the Special Action Account shall not be used in substitution for regular resources of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( " the Bank " ) or of the Association committed under a loan or credit for a programme or project which , at the effective date of this Agreement , shall have been approved by the executive directors of the Bank or the Association .
Except as provided in Section 4 , the terms of repayment of each Special Action Credit shall be the same as those generally applicable to development credits made by the Association , that is to say , it shall be repayable over 50 years and with a 10-year grace period .
Special Action Credits shall be made in one or more currencies of the Member States and shall be repayable in those currencies .
Consistent with the normal procedures of the Association , the administrator is authorized to require each borrower under a Special Action Credit to pay to the Association a service charge at the rate of three fourths of one per cent ( 3 / 4 of 1 % ) per annum , payable in any currency acceptable to the Association , ( 1 ) As those terms are defined from time to time by or pursuant to Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. on the principal amount of the Credit withdrawn and outstanding from time to time to compensate it for the services rendered hereunder .
Amounts paid for this charge shall be paid directly to and retained by the Association .
Each Special Action Credit shall be evidenced by a separate credit agreement between the borrowing country and the administrator , indicating in particular the origin of the resources .
The proceeds of each Special Action Credit may be used for expenditures in the currency of the borrowing country or for goods produced in , or services supplied from , ( i ) any of the Member States ; ( ii ) developing countries which are members of the Association and which could be recipients of a Special Action Credit , as determined by the administrator at the time of the agreement of the credit .
The principal repayments of Special Action Credits shall be made payable to the Special Action Account and the amount of the currency of a Member State so repaid shall as soon as practicable thereafter be returned by the administrator to such Member State .
The Association shall not be liable for any shortfall in the repayment of Special Action Credits .
Until all Special Action Credits shall have been committed , the administrator shall keep the EEC informed of projects and programmes being prepared for consideration by the executive directors and those which have been approved by the executive directors .
During the period of disbursement of Special Action Credits the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly of the progress of the Special Action Credits and of the disbursements made thereunder .
The administrator shall , as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Association , furnish to the EEC a detailed statement of the Special Action Account , together with an opinion of the Association 's own external auditors of such statement .
After the Special Action Credits shall have been fully disbursed , the administrator shall as soon as practicable furnish to the EEC a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed from the Special Action Account .
The administrator shall establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify the contributions to the Special Action Account , the commitments to be financed out of the Account , and the receipts and disbursements of funds in the Account and repayments to the Member States .
The EEC and the administrator shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the purposes of these arrangements .
To that end , until the Special Action Account is fully disbursed , the EEC ( acting through the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator shall , from time to time , exchange views on the status and condition of the Special Action Account , on the progress of the programmes or projects financed out of the Special Action Credits , and on all other matters relating to these arrangements .
If this Agreement shall not have become effective by 31 December 1978 , or such later date as may be agreed between the EEC and the Association , this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate .
If and when the entire principal amount of all Special Action Credits withdrawn by borrowers thereunder shall have been repaid and returned to the Member States in accordance with Section 8 of Article II of this Agreement , this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate .
This Agreement shall be approved by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party .
The Government of each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities when such procedural requirements applicable to it have been completed .
The General Secretariat shall forward such notification , together with a notification that the EEC has duly approved this Agreement , to the Association .
This Agreement shall become effective and enter into force on the first day of the month following receipt by the Association of such notifications .

AGREEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Settlements concerning the mobilization of claims held by the Member States under the medium-term financial assistance arrangements
The BIS could conclude stand-by credit agreements with the creditor countries ' central banks if they should so request .
These agreements could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid into the mechanism by the creditor country , with an overall limit of 2 725 million units of account , corresponding to half of the total of future commitment ceilings of the member countries .
The practical details of each stand-by agreement would be determined by agreement between the BIS and the central bank in question .
However , certain conditions , which the BIS would be prepared to apply , can be indicated already :
The initial commitment of the BIS for each stand-by credit would be for two years with the option of renewal for other periods , the total not to exceed five years .
On the opening of credits , and whenever they are renewed , the BIS would take a Commission .
It would also be understood that , in order to allow it to carry out the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity , the first drawings would not take place until one month after the conclusion of the stand-by agreement .
Drawings would be in the currencies available to the BIS at the time the agreements were concluded , most probably in US dollars ; they would be for periods to be negotiated in the light of the Bank 's resources , probably three or six months .
The conditions would be equivalent to those applied by the BIS at the time for transactions concluded on similar terms , i.e. at close to market rates .
Normally , these rates should be only slightly above Libor .
However , if the BIS should itself have to have recourse to the market to procure the necessary funds , the rate applied could reach a maximum equivalent to Libor plus an appropriate margin .
I should be obliged if you would inform me whether the Council of the European Communities is in agreement with the above .
Please accept , Sir , the assurance of my highest consideration .

The Parties to the Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade ( hereinafter referred to as " the Agreement " ) ,
Having regard to the multilateral trade negotiations and to the desire expressed by the Trade Negotiations Committee at its meeting of 11 and 12 April 1979 to arrive at a single text of an Agreement on implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement of tariffs and trade ;
Recognizing that developing countries may have particular problems in applying the Agreement ;
Considering that the provisions of Article 27 of the Agreement relating to amendments have not yet entered into force ;
In such cases a developing country Party to the Agreement may request before the end of the period referred to in Article 21 ( 1 ) an extension of such period , it being understood that the Parties to the Agreement will give sympathetic consideration to such a request in cases where the developing country in question can show good cause ;

ARRANGEMENT in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade in mutton and lamb
I have the honour to refer to the negotiations recently undertaken between our respective delegations for the purpose of drawing up provisions concerning import into the European Economic Community of mutton , lamb and goatmeat from Argentina , on connection with implementation by the Community of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat .
During these negotiations both parties agreed as follows : 1 .
This arrangement shall relate to : - fresh or chilled mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( 02.01 A IV a ) ) ,
- frozen mutton , lamb and goatmeat ( 02.01 A IV b ) ) .
Within the terms of this arrangement , the possibilities of export of mutton and lamb and goatmeat from Argentina to the Community are fixed at the following annual quantity : 20 000 tonnes expressed in carcass weight ( 1 ) .
In order to ensure the proper functioning of the arrangement , Argentina undertakes to implement the appropriate procedures to ensure that the annual quantity actually exported does not exceed the quantity agreed and shall be exported in accordance with the traditional patterns of presentation ( frozen or chilled ) .
Should changes in technology and trade make it possible to modify the presentational structure of trade , the two parties to this arrangement will consult each other prior to any such modification in the Committee mentioned in clause 10 in order to find an adequate solution .
Should the Community have recourse to the safeguard clause , it undertakes that Argentina 's access into the Community as provided for in this arrangement will not be affected .
If imports in any one year exceed the quantities agreed , the Community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of that year .
The quantity overshipped shall be offset against Argentina 's export entitlement for the following year .

PROTOCOL TO THE EUROPEAN AGREEMENT on the Exchange of Blood-grouping Reagents
A blood-grouping ( 1 ) reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label .
When a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena : ( a ) haemolytic properties ;
( b ) antibodies or other substances besides those mentioned on the label ;
( c ) bacterial products liable to cause false positive or false negative reactions ;
( d ) pseudo-agglutination through the formation of rouleaux ;
Titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium .
To each dilution is added an equal volume of a suspension of red corpuscles .
The titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs , the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume .
In the case of anti-A , anti-B and other reagents intended for use on slides , avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide .
International Standards have been established by the World Health Organization for anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D blood-grouping reagents and are in process of being established for blood-grouping reagents of other specificities .
An International Standard Preparation contains , by definition , a certain number of International Units per mg or ml and this definition is independent of the titres observed against particular red corpuscle preparations ( 2 ) .
( 1 ) At the time of approving the present version of the Protocol and its Annexes , it was understood by the representatives of the Contracting Parties that when in the English text of the Agreement the expression " blood incompatibilities " was mentioned , " blood grouping incompatibilities " was implied .

( a ) SERA OF HUMAN ORIGIN FOR AB0 GROUPING ( i ) Anti-A blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of selected group B persons , who may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substance .
Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB , including sub-groups A1 , A2 , A1B and A2B , and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1 , A2 , and A2B corpuscles , in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation .
The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml .
When anti-A serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of A1 , A2 and A2B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination of each suspension should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity .
Anti-B serum is derived from the blood of selected group A persons , who may or may not have been immunized by group B red corpuscles or group B specific substance .
Anti-B serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB , and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.
An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation .
The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml .
When anti-B serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination should first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or with reference standard of equivalent avidity .
Anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum is derived from the blood of selected group 0 persons who may or may not have been immunized by group A and group B red corpuscles or group A and group B specific substances .
Anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A or B agglutinogens or both , i.e. those of group A including subgroups A1 and A2 , group B and group AB including subgroups A1B and A2B , and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A or B agglutinogens , i.e. those of group 0 .
It agglutinates human red corpuscles containing the Ax ( Ay or Ao ) antigen ( which are not , in general , agglutinated by anti-A serum derived from group B donors ) .
An anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1 , and A2 corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation .
It shall also be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation .
The potency of the serum shall in every case be not less than 64 International Units per ml .
Anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) blood-grouping serum used undiluted shall also give readily detectable agglutination of group Ax ( Ay or Ao ) corpuscles .
When anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide with equal volumes of suspensions of A1 and A2 cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same tests are performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or with a reference standard of equivalent avidity .
When anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of B cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination shall first appear in not more than twice the time taken when the same test is performed with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or a reference preparation of equivalent avidity .
When anti-A + anti-B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ax ( Ay or Ao ) cells with a volume fraction of 0,05 to 0,1 , agglutination shall first appear in not more than five minutes at a temperature between 18 and 25 ° C.
Anti-Rh blood-grouping sera , whatever their specificity , may be of either of two varieties differing in the conditions under which agglutination of homologous corpuscles is obtained .
Certain sera commonly known as " complete " agglutinate corpuscles suspended in saline .
With others , commonly known as " incomplete " , agglutination can only be obtained in the presence of certain colloids such as bovine albumin or by means of other special techniques .
The sera should be used under the conditions specified by the laboratory preparing them .
Some " incomplete " sera will also agglutinate homologous red corpuscles suspended in their own serum or plasma on slides .
The following requirements of potency for Rh grouping sera may need to be revised when International Standard Preparations become available . ( i ) Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the D antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the D antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the D antigen .
" Complete " anti-D sera shall have a titre of not less than 32 against CcDee cells in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
An " incomplete " anti-D serum shall be titrated against CcDee corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of Incomplete Anti-D ( anti-Rho ) or an equivalent reference preparation .
It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units .
Besides reacting with all red corpuscles containing the D antigen , the serum should , as far as possible , react with corpuscles containing the Du antigen .
Anti-D sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a 40 to 50 % suspension of CcDee corpuscles at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
Anti-C serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the C agglutinogen of the Rh system .
It agglutinates suspensions of human red corpuscles containing the C antigen , but not with human red corpuscles which do not contain the C antigen .
In this connection the C antigen is regarded as including the Cw antigen .
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain " complete " anti-C together with " incomplete " anti-D .
These sera are therefore specific for the C antigen only when the cells under test are suspended in a solution containing 9 grams sodium chloride per litre .
Anti-C sera ( " complete " or " incomplete " ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles .
Anti-C sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must not contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of Ccddee cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iii ) Anti-E ( anti-rh " ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-E serum is derived from the blood of one or more persons immunized by the E antigen of the Rh system .
It reacts with human red corpuscles containing the E antigen .
Anti-E sera ( " complete " or " incomplete " ) should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles .
Anti-E sera intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson ( and which must contain any form of anti-D ) should , when mixed on a slide with an equal volume of a suspension of ccddEe cells with a volume fraction of 0,4 to 0,5 , at approximately 40 ° C , show visible agglutination within 30 seconds , and agglutination should be complete within 120 seconds .
( iv ) Anti-D + C ( anti-Rhorh ' ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Anti-D + E ( anti-Rhorh " ) blood-grouping serum ( human )
Sera of specificity anti-D + C and of specificity anti-D + E may be obtained directly from the blood of immunized individuals or may be prepared by mixing anti-D with anti-C or anti-E serum .
In a given serum both antibodies must be simultaneously active under the conditions of reaction specified by the producer .
Each serum must react with all types of red corpuscles which would react with either of the component antibodies , and must fail to react with red corpuscles which contain neither the C nor D antigen in the case of anti-D + C and neither D nor E antigen in the case of anti-D + E. The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies , but in the case of anti-D + C ( which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunized persons ) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should be not less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should be not less than 8 .
Where a serum is intended for use in the slide test of Diamond and Abelson , the times of agglutination for all reacting types of red corpuscles should be not less than those specified for the component antibodies .
( a ) SERA OF ANIMAL ORIGIN ( i ) Anti-A blood-grouping serum ( animal )
Anti-A serum is derived from the blood of animals which may or may not have been immunized by group A red corpuscles or group A specific substances .
Anti-A serum agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB , including sub-groups A1 , A2 , A1B and A2B , and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.

Anti-human globulin serum for use in blood group serology must contain agglutinating antibodies against IgG globulin and agglutinating antibodies against complement factors .
It is derived from the blood of animals immunized by the injection of human serum protein .
It must agglutinate all human red corpuscles coated with human IgG and / or complement factors .
Under the conditions specified by the manufacturers it does not agglutinate uncoated human red corpuscles , to whatever group they may belong .
The specificity of an anti-human globulin serum for use in blood group serology must be tested with human red corpuscles coated with a variety of antibodies i.e. red corpuscles sensitized with human incomplete antibodies anti-D , anti-K and anti-Fya , red corpuscles sensitized with complement-binding incomplete antibodies anti-Lea in the presence of fresh human serum , and red corpuscles sensitized with socalled " incomplete cold antibodies " ( 1 ) The International Standard Preparation is of human origin ; an equivalent reference preparation , if used , may be of human or non-human origin .
and with tanned red corpuscles sensitized with human IgG and , finally , with 10 different samples of non-coated human red corpuscles with and without A and B antigens .
An anti-human globulin serum , as supplied , or at the dilution recommended on the label , shall strongly agglutinate human red corpuscles coated with a human incomplete anti-D serum , having a titre of 4 ( or less ) against D-positive corpuscles , when the titration is performed by the albumin replacement method .
At the same dilution it shall agglutinate K-positive human red corpuscles sensitized with selected weak anti-K antibodies and Fya positive red corpuscles sensitized with selected weak anti-Fya antibodies .
It shall also , at the same or a different dilution , as specified on the label , agglutinate human red corpuscles sensitized with weak complement-binding incomplete anti-Lea antibodies in the presence of fresh serum .
For clinical use it is desirable that the coating of all the types of incomplete antibodies above shall be detectable with a single dilution of the anti-human globulin serum .

Anti-A reagent agglutinates human red corpuscles containing A antigens , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB , including sub-groups A1 , A2 , A1B and A2B , and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigens , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B.
An anti-A reagent shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1 , A2 and A2B corpuscles , in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation ( 1 ) .
The potency of the reagent shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml .
Anti-B reagent is prepared by extraction from the appropriate part of a suitable plant , followed , if necessary , by purification .
Anti-B reagent agglutinates human red corpuscles containing B antigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB , and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A.

CONVENTION on the simplification of formalities in trade in goods
CONSIDERING the Free Trade Agreements between the Community and each of the EFTA countries ;
CONSIDERING the Joint Declaration calling for the creation of a European economic space , adopted by Ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community and the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984 , especially with regard to simplification of border formalities and rules of origin ;
CONSIDERING that , in the framework of action to strengthen the internal market , the Community has decided to introduce a single administrative document for use in such trade from 1 January 1988 ;
CONSIDERING it appropriate to simplify also formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries as well as between the EFTA countries themselves , in particular by introducing a single administrative document ;
CONSIDERING that no provision of this Convention may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from their obligations under other international agreements ,
This Convention lays down measures to simplify formalities in trade in goods between the Community and the EFTA countries , as well as between the EFTA countries themselves , in particular by introducing a single administrative document ( hereinafter referred to as the single document ) to be used for any procedure at export and import and for a common transit procedure applicable to trade between the Contracting Parties ( hereinafter referred to as transit ) , regardless of the kind and origin of the goods .
Where goods are the subject of trade between the Contracting Parties , the formalities connected with such trade shall be completed using a single document based on a declaration form , the specimens of which are to be found in Annex I to this Convention .
The single document shall , depending on the circumstances , serve as a declaration or document of export , transit or import .
Administrative documents may be required by a Contracting Party in addition to the single document only where :
- expressly required for the implementation of a legislation in force in a Contracting Party for which the use of the single document would not suffice ;
- required under the terms of international agreements to which it is a party ;
- required from operators to enable them to qualify , at their request , for an advantage or a specific facility .
In such cases , a declaration , which , if the competent authorities agree , may be a general periodic declaration , must be submitted subsequently within the time-limits laid down by those authorities .
In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 , operators may be authorized to use commercial documents in the place of the single document .
Where the single document is used , the persons concerned may , on authorization by the competent authorities , attach to it commercial schedules describing the goods in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document for the purpose of completing formalities for any procedure at export and import .
- dispensing with the single document with regard to postal traffic ( by letter or parcel post ) ;
- dispensing with the requirement of written declarations ;
- concluding between themselves agreements or arrangements with a view to greater simplification of formalities in all or part of the trade between them ;
- allowing the use of loading lists for the completion of transit formalities in the case of consignments composed of several kinds of goods , in lieu of continuation sheets of the single document ;
- allowing declarations to be made , where appropriate on plain paper , by means of public or private computers on conditions fixed by the competent authorities ;
- enabling the competent authorities to require that data necessary for completing the formalities in question be entered in their computerized declaration-processing systems without , where appropriate , requiring a written declaration ;
- enabling the competent authorities , should a computerized declaration-processing system be used , to provide that the export , transit or import declaration be constituted either by the single document produced by that system or by entry of the data in the computer if such a document is not produced ;
- applying any facility adopted by way of a decision of the Joint Committee , as referred to in Article 11 ( 3 ) .
Where necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or of transit may require from the declarant or his representative in that country a translation of the said declaration into the official language or one of the official languages of that country .
( 2 ) Abweichend von Absatz 1 ist die Anmeldung immer dann in einer der Amtssprachen des Einfuhrlandes auszufuellen , wenn sie in diesem Land unter Verwendung von anderen als den der Zollstelle des Ausfuhr- oder Abgangslandes vorgelegten Exemplaren der Anmeldung erfolgt . By way of derogation from paragraph 1 , the declaration shall be completed in one of the official languages of the country of import in all cases where the declaration in that country is made on copies of the declaration from other than those presented to the customs authorities of the country of export or departure .
However , without prejudice to specific provisions concerning groupage traffic , the competent authorities may lay down that formalities relating to export and transit operations should be completed on the same form by means of copies corresponding to these formalities .
In the cases referred to in Article 7 , the competent authorities shall , to the extent possible , satisfy themselves that the particulars given in the copies of the declaration drawn up in the course of the various stages of the operation in question all agree .
each other with all available information ( including administrative reports and findings ) of interest for the proper implementation of this Convention .
Compliance with such a request shall be at the discretion of the customs authority to whom the request is made .
Such information may be used for other purposes only with the written consent of the customs authority which furnished them and subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority .
Any Contracting Party may request that a meeting be held .
For this purpose , the said Committee shall be kept regularly informed , by the Contracting Parties , of the experiences gained from application of the Convention , shall make recommendations , and , in the cases provided for in paragraph 3 , shall take decisions .
( b ) any other measure required for its application .
Such decisions shall put into effect by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their own legislation .

This suggestion was welcomed by the Council , which invited the Commission of the European Communities to study how best to implement such cooperation .
In February 1991 the Commission proposed the concept of a European Energy Charter .
Following discussion of the Commission 's proposal in the Council of the European Communities , the European Communities invited the other countries of western and eastern Europe , of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the non-European members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to attend a conference in Brussels in July 1991 to launch negotiations on the European Energy Charter .
A number of other countries and international organizations were invited to attend the European Energy Charter Conference as observers .
Negotiations on the European Energy Charter were completed in 1991 and the Charter was adopted by signature of a Concluding Document at a conference held at The Hague on 16 to 17 December 1991 .
Signatories of the Charter , then or subsequently , include all those listed in Section I , other than observers .
The signatories of the European Energy Charter undertook :
- to pursue the objectives and principles of the Charter and implement and broaden their cooperation as soon as possible by negotiating in good faith a Basic Agreement and Protocols .
The European Energy Charter Conference accordingly began negotiations on a Basic Agreement - later called the Energy Charter Treaty - designed to promote east-west industrial cooperation by providing legal safeguards in areas such as investment , transit and trade .
It also began negotiations on Protocols in the fields of energy efficiency , nuclear safety and hydrocarbons , although in the last case negotiations were later suspended until completion of the Energy Charter Treaty .
Negotiations on the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects were successfully completed in 1994 .

Australia further notes that it would not be appropriate for dispute settlement bodies established under the Treaty to give interpretations of GATT Articles III and XI in the context of disputes between parties to the GATT or between an investor of a party to the GATT and another party to the GATT .
It considers that with respect to the application of Article 10 ( 11 ) between an investor and a party to the GATT , the only issue that can be considered under Article 26 is the issue of the awards of arbitration in the event that a GATT panel or the WTO dispute settlement body first establishes that a trade-related investment measure maintained by the Contracting Party is inconsistent with its obligations under the GATT or the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures .
3. Zu Artikel 7 With respect to Article 7
The European Communities and their Member States and Austria , Norway , Sweden and Finland declare that the provisions of Article 7 are subject to the conventional rules of international law on jurisdiction over submarine cables and pipelines or , where there are no such rules , to general international law .
They further declare that Article 7 is not intended to affect the interpretation of existing international law on jurisdiction over submarine cables and pipelines , and cannot be considered as doing so .
4. Zu Artikel 10 With respect to Article 10
Canada and the United States of America each affirm that they will apply the provisions of Article 10 in accordance with the following considerations :
For the purposes of assessing the treatment which must be accorded to investors of other Contracting Parties and their investments , the circumstances will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis .
A comparison between the treatment accorded to investors of one Contracting Party , or the investments of investors of one Contracting Party , and the investments or investors of another Contracting Party , is only valid if it is made between investors and investments in similar circumstances .
In determining whether differential treatment of investors or investments is consistent with Article 10 , two basic factors must be taken into account .
The first factor is the policy objectives of Contracting Parties in various fields in so far as they are consistent with the principles of non-discrimination set out in Article 10 .
Legitimate policy objectives may justify differential treatment of foreign investors or their investments in order to reflect a dissimilarity of relevant circumstances between those investors and investments and their domestic counterparts .
For example , the objective of ensuring the integrity of a country 's financial system would justify reasonable prudential measures with respect to foreign investors or investments , where such measures would be unnecessary to ensure the attainment of the same objectives in so far as domestic investors or investments are concerned .
Those foreign investors or their investments would thus not be ' in similar circumstances
Thus , even if such a measure accorded differential treatment , it would not be contrary to Article 10 .
The second factor is the extent to which the measure is motivated by the fact that the relevant investor or investment is subject to foreign ownership or under foreign control .
5. Zu Artikel 25 With respect to Article 25
The European Communities and their Member States recall that , in accordance with Article 58 of the Treaty establishing the European Community :
( a ) companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and having their registered office , central administration or principal place of business within the Community shall , for the right of establishment pursuant to Part Three , Title III , Chapter 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States ; companies or firms which only have their registered office within the Community must , for this purpose , have an effective and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States ;
( b ) ' companies and firms
The European Communities and their Member States further recall that :
Community law provides for the possibility to extend the treatment described above to branches and agencies of companies or firms not established in one of the Member States ; and that , the application of Article 25 of the Energy Charter Treaty will allow only those derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential treatment resulting from the wider process of economic integration resulting from the Treaties establishing the European Communities .
6. Zu Artikel 40 With respect to Article 40
Denmark recalls that the European Energy Charter does not apply to Greenland and the Faroe Islands until notice to this effect has been received from the local governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands .
In this respect Denmark affirms that Article 40 of the Treaty applies to Greenland and the Faroe Islands .

AGREEMENT to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas
RECOGNIZING that all States have the right for their nationals to engage in fishing on the high seas , subject to the relevant rules of international law , as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ,
FURTHER RECOGNIZING that , under international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , all States have the duty to take , or to cooperate with other States in taking , such measures for their respective nationals as may be necessary for the conservation of the living resources of the high seas ,
ACKNOWLEDGING the right and interest of all States to develop their fishing sectors in accordance with their national policies , and the need to promote cooperation with developing countries to enhance their capabilities to fulfil their obligations under this Agreement ,
RECALLING that Agenda 21 , adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , calls upon States to take effective action , consistent with international law , to deter reflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable conservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas ,
FURTHER RECALLING that the Declaration of Cancún , adopted by the International Conference on Responsible Fishing , also calls on States to take action in this respect ,
BEARING IN MIND that under Agenda 21 , States commit themselves to the conservation and sustainable use of marine living resources on the high seas ,
CALLING UPON States which do not participate in global , regional or subregional fisheries organizations or arrangements to join or , as appropriate , to enter into understandings with such organizations or with parties to such organizations or arrangements with a view to achieving compliance with international conservation and management measures ,
CONSCIOUS OF the duties of every State to exercise effectively its jurisdiction and control over vessels flying its flag , including fishing vessels and vessels engaged in the transhipment of fish ,
MINDFUL that the practice of flagging or reflagging fishing vessels as a means of avoiding compliance with international conservation and management measures for living marine resources , and the failure of flag States to fulfil their responsibilities with respect to fishing vessels entitled to fly their flag , are among the factors that seriously undermine the effectiveness of such measures ,
REALIZING that the objective of this Agreement can be achieved through specifying flag States ' responsibility in respect of fishing vessels entitled to fly their flags and operating on the high seas , including the authorization by the flag State of such operations , as well as through strengthened international cooperation and increased transparency through the exchange of information of high seas fishing ,
NOTING that this Agreement will form an integral part of the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing called for in the Declaration of Cancún ,
DESIRING to conclude an international agreement within the framework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , hereinafter referred to as FAO , under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution ,
For the purposes of this Agreement :
( a ) ' fishing vessel
( b ) ' international conservation and management measures
Such measures may be adopted either by global , regional or subregional fisheries organizations , subject to the rights and obligations of their members , or by treaties or other international agreements ;
( i ) for any fishing vessel built after 18 July 1982 , 96 % of the total length on a waterline at 85 % of the least moulded depth measured from the top of the keel , or the length from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock on that waterline , if that be greater .
In ships designed with a rake of keel the waterline on which this length is measures shall be parallel to the designed waterline ;
( ii ) for any fishing vessel built before 18 July 1982 , registered length as entered on the national register or other record of vessels ;
( d ) ' record of fishing vessels
It may constitute a separate record for fishing vessels or form part of a general record of vessels ;
( e ) ' regional economic integration organization
( f ) ' vessels entitled to fly its flag '
A party may exempt fishing vessels of less than 24 metres in length entitled to fly its flag from the application of this Agreement unless the party determines that such an exemption would undermine the object and purpose of this Agreement , provided that such exemptions :
( a ) shall not be granted in respect of fishing vessels operating in fishing regions referred to in paragraph 3 below , other than fishing vessels that are entitled to fly the flag of a coastal State of that fishing region ; and
( b ) shall not apply to the obligations undertaken by a party under paragraph 1 of Article III , or paragraph 7 of Article VI of this Agreement .
1 . ( a ) Each party shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag do not engage in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures .
( b ) In the event that a party has , pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article II , granted an exemption for fishing vessels of less than 24 metres in length entitled to fly its flag from the application of other provisions of this Agreement , such party shall nevertheless take effective measures in respect of any such fishing vessel that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures .
These measures shall be such as to ensure that the fishing vessel ceases to engage in activities that undermine the effectiveness of the international conservation and management measures .
A fishing vessel so authorized shall fish in accordance with the conditions of the authorization .
5 . ( a ) No party shall authorize any fishing vessel previously registered in the territory of another party that has undermined the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures to be used for fishing on the high seas , unless it is satisfied that :
( i ) any period of suspension by another party of an authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has expired ; and
( ii ) no authorization for such fishing vessel to be used for fishing on the high seas has been withdrawn by another party within the last three years .
( b ) The provisions of subparagraph ( a ) above shall also apply in respect of fishing vessels previously registered in the territory of a State which is not a party to this Agreement , provided that sufficient information is available to the party concerned on the circumstances in which the authorization to fish was suspended or withdrawn .
( c ) The provisions of subparagraphs ( a ) and ( b ) shall not apply where the ownership of the fishing vessel has subsequently changed , and the new owner has provided sufficient evidence demonstrating that the previous owner or operator has no further legal , beneficial or financial interest in , or control of , the fishing vessel .
( d ) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs ( a ) and ( b ) above , a party may authorize a fishing vessel , to which those subparagraphs would otherwise apply , to be used for fishing on the high seas , where the party concerned , after having taken into account all relevant facts , including the circumstances in which the fishing authorization has been withdrawn by the other party or State , has determined that to grant an authorization to use the vessel for fishing on the high seas would not undermine the object and purpose of this Agreement .
Sanctions applicable in respect of such contraventions shall be of sufficient gravity as to be effective in securing compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and to deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities .
Such sanctions shall , for serious offences , include refusal , suspension or withdrawal of the authorization to fish on the high seas .
Each party shall , for the purposes of this Agreement , maintain a record of fishing vessels entitled to fly its flag and authorized to be used for fishing on the high seas , and shall take such measures as may be necessary to ensure that all such fishing vessels are entered in that record .
Parties may make arrangements regarding the undertaking by port States of such investigatory measures as may be considered necessary to establish whether the fishing vessel has indeed been used contrary to the provisions of this Agreement .

Reports on measures imposed by a party may be subject to such limitations as may be required by national legislation with respect to confidentiality , including , in particular , confidentiality regarding measures that are not yet final .
( b ) Each party , where it has reasonable grounds to believe that a fishing vessel not entitled to fly its flag has engaged in any activity that undermines the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures , shall draw this to the attention of the flag State concerned and may , as appropriate , draw it to the attention of FAO .
It shall provide that flag State with full supporting evidence and may provide FAO with a summary of such evidence .
FAO shall not circulate such information until such time as the flag State has had an opportunity to comment on the allegation and evidence submitted , or to object as the case may be .

- for those categories of textile products previously subject to quantitative limits and set out in Annex II , any quantitative restraint fixed under the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 for category of products shall be set at a level not lower than the level of the 1997 quota for the category in question and shall not be triggered until imports into the Community of products of Russian origin of that category have reached 5 % of the total imports into the Community for that category .
Accordingly , the Parties will establish the necessary legal provisions and / or administrative procedures to address and take action against such circumvention .
The Parties , consistent with their domestic laws and procedures , will cooperate fully to address problems arising from circumvention .
Such consultations should be held promptly , and within 30 days when possible .
The Parties agree to cooperate fully , consistent with their domestic laws and procedures , in instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention of this Agreement , to establish the relevant facts in the places of import , export and , where applicable , transhipment .
Such cooperation , consistent with domestic laws and procedures , will include : investigation of circumvention practices which increase restrained exports to the territory of the Party maintaining such restraints : exchange of documents , correspondence , reports and other relevant information to the extent available ; and facilitation of plant visits and contacts , on request and on a case-by-case basis .
The Party should endeavour to clarify the circumstances of any such instances of circumvention or alleged circumvention , including the respective roles of the exporters or importers involved .
Also , where there is evidence of the involvement of the territory of either Party through which goods have been transhipped , such action may include the introduction of restraints with respect to the Party concerned .
Any such actions , together with their timing and scope , may be taken after consultations held with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution between the Parties .

RESOLVED to take precautionary measures to anticipate , prevent or minimise emissions of air pollutants and mitigate their adverse effects ,
CONVINCED that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage , lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing such measures , taking into account that such precautionary measures to deal with emissions of air pollutants should be cost-effective ,
MINDFUL that measures to control emissions of sulphur and other air pollutants would also contribute to the protection of the sensitive Arctic environment ,
CONSIDERING that the predominant sources of air pollution contributing to the acidification of the environment are the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production , and the main technological processes in various industrial sectors , as well as transport , which lead to emissions of sulphur , nitrogen oxides , and other pollutants ,
CONSCIOUS of the need for a cost-effective regional approach to combating air pollution that takes account of the variations in effects and abatement costs between countries ,
DESIRING to take further and more effective action to control and reduce sulphur emissions ,
COGNISANT that any sulphur control policy , however cost-effective it may be at the regional level , will result in a relatively heavy economic burden on countries with economies that are in transition to a market economy ,
BEARING IN MIND that measures taken to reduce sulphur emissions should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international competition and trade ,
TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION existing scientific and technical data on emissions , atmospheric processes and effects on the environment of sulphur oxides , as well as on abatement costs ,
AWARE that , in addition to emissions of sulphur , emissions of nitrogen oxides and of ammonia are also causing acidification of the environment ,
NOTING that under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , adopted in New York on 9 May 1992 , there is agreement to establish national policies and take corresponding measures to combat climate change , which can be expected to lead to reductions of sulphur emissions ,
AFFIRMING the need to ensure environmentally sound and sustainable development ,
RECOGNISING the need to continue scientific and technical cooperation to elaborate further the approach based on critical loads and critical levels , including efforts to assess several air pollutants and various effects on the environment , materials and human health ,
UNDERLINING that scientific and technical knowledge is developing and that it will be necessary to take such developments into account when reviewing the adequacy of the obligations entered into under the present Protocol and deciding on further action ,
ACKNOWLEDGING the Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions or Their Transboundary Fluxes by at least 30 per cent , adopted in Helsinki on 8 July 1985 , and the measures already taken by many countries which have had the effect of reducing sulphur emissions ,

This Agreement replaces the Cooperation Agreement between the Kingdom of Belgium , the French Republic , the Federal Republic of Germany , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg , the Kingdom of the Netherlands , the Italian Republic , the Kingdom of Spain , the Portuguese Republic , the Hellenic Republic , the Republic of Austria , the Kingdom of Denmark , the Republic of Finland , the Kingdom of Sweden , Contracting Parties to the Schengen Agreement and the Schengen Convention , and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the abolition of controls on persons at their common borders , signed in Luxembourg on 19 December 1996 .
between the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers
The Council refers to the negotiations concerning the Agreement concerning the association of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway to the implementation , application and development of the Schengen acquis and has taken good note of the request of Iceland and Norway , in the spirit of their participation in the decision-making process in the fields covered by the Agreement and in order to enhance the good functioning of the Agreement , to be fully associated with the work of the committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers .
The Council notes that in future , when such procedures will be applied in the fields covered by the Agreement , there will indeed be a need to associate Iceland and Norway with the work of these committees , also in order to ensure that the procedures of the Agreement have been applied to the acts or measures concerned , so that these may become binding on Iceland and Norway .
Therefore , the European Community is ready to commit itself to negotiate , as soon as the need arises , appropriate arrangements for the association of Iceland and Norway with the work of these committees .
I should be obliged if you would inform me of whether or not your Government is in agreement with the above .
Please accept , Sir , the assurance of my highest consideration .
Recalling that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members and that it wishes to cooperate with other States in the protection of live animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes ;
Recognising that man has a moral obligation to respect all animals and to have due consideration for their capacity for suffering and memory ;
Accepting nevertheless that man in his quest for knowledge , health and safety has a need to use animals where there is a reasonable expectation that the result will be to extend knowledge or be to the overall benefit of man or animal , just as he uses them for food , clothing and as beasts of burden ;
Resolved to limit the use of animals for experimental and other scientific purposes , with the aim of replacing such use wherever practical , in particular by seeking alternative measures and encouraging the use of these alternative measures ;
Desirous to adopt common provisions in order to protect animals used in those procedures which may possibly cause pain , suffering , distress or lasting harm and to ensure that where unavoidable they shall be kept to a minimum ,
It does not apply to any non-experimental agricultural or clinical veterinary practice .
( a ) " animal " , unless otherwise qualified , means any live non-human vertebrate including free-living and / or reproducing larval forms , but excluding other foetal or embryonic forms ;

between the European Community and Ukraine amending the agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on trade in textile products
A. Letter from the Council of the European Union
For this purpose it was agreed that the Parties would negotiate during the year 2000 a longer-term agreement aiming at the full liberalisation of trade in textiles , in parallel with alignment of Ukrainian tariffs to the rates applied by the European Community .
Such agreement will aim at the elimination , upon its entry into force , of quantitative restrictions for product categories whose utilisation rates were below 2 % in 1999 ( categories 1 , 2 , 2A , 3 , 9 , 12 , 20 , 23 , 37 , 67 and 115 ) .
Annex I which sets out the products referred to in Article 1 of the Agreement shall be replaced by Annex I to EC Regulation 3030 / 93 ( Appendix 1 to this letter gives further details ) .
Annex II which sets out the quantitative restrictions for exports from Ukraine to the European Community shall be replaced by Appendix 2 to this letter .
For the year 1999 there will be an increase of 60 % for quantitative limits for textile categories 6 , 7 , 15 and 16 , and an increase of 50 % for categories 5 , 26 / 27 , 29 and 50 .
For the year 2000 , the increase will be , subject to the conditions and procedures of paragraph 5 of this letter , 30 % for all textile categories over the effective 1999 levels , with the exception of categories 5 , 6 , 7 , 15 , 16 , 26 / 27 , 29 and 50 , which will be increased by 50 % over the effective 1999 levels .
The Annex to Protocol C which sets out the quantitative restrictions for exports from the Republic of Ukraine to the European Community after OPT operations in the Republic of Ukraine shall be replaced by Appendix 3 to this letter .
The second and third sentence of Article 20 , paragraph 1 , shall be replaced by the following text : " It shall be applicable until 31 December 2000 . "
In order to monitor the implementation of the Agreement , both parties will hold consultations during the first quarter of 2000 , in which the quantitative limits for the year 2000 as set out in Appendix 2 may also be reviewed in order to further facilitate the expansion of trade .
The increase of the levels of quantitative limits for the year 2000 , as set out in Appendix 2 , will be effected automatically upon confirmation that the tariff levels have been reduced to the levels established in Appendix 3 .
Ukraine undertakes to provide such confirmation by 31 March 2000 .
The Parties also agreed that the volume of quantitative limits of year 2000 would be the same as those of 1999 until the moment when Ukraine applies the import tariff levels specified in Annex III .
7. Sollte die Ukraine vor dem Ablauf der Geltungsdauer des Abkommens Mitglied der Welthandelsorganisation werden , so finden dieses Abkommen und seine Anhänge weiterhin Anwendung als Verwaltungsvereinbarung und werden als solche der Welthandelsorganisation notifiziert , und seine Bestimmungen werden im Rahmen der Übereinkommen und Regeln der Welthandelsorganisation angewendet . Should Ukraine become a Member to the World Trade Organisation before the date of expiry of the Agreement , this Agreement and its annexes will be applied and notified to the World Trade Organisation as an Administrative Arrangement , and its provisions will be applied within the framework of the Agreements and rules of the World Trade Organisation .
8. Ich wäre Ihnen dankbar , wenn Sie die Zustimmung Ihrer Regierung hierzu bestätigen . I should be obliged if you could kindly confirm the acceptance of your Government of the foregoing .
Should this be the case , this Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the day on which the Parties have notified each other that the legal procedures necessary to this end have been completed .
In the meantime , it shall be applied provisionally no later than 1 December 1999 on the conditions to be specified in an Exchange of Notes ( see Appendix 5 ) .
