Determined to implement the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution,
Concerned hat emissions of certain heavy metals are transported across national boundaries and may cause damage to ecosystems of environmental and economic importance and may have harmful effects on human health,
Considering hat combustion and industrial processes are the predominant anthropogenic sources of emissions of heavy metals into the atmosphere,
Acknowledging that heavy metals are natural constituents of the Earth 's crust and that many heavy metals in certain forms and appropriate concentrations are essential to life,
Taking into consideration existing scientific and technical data on the emissions, geochemical processes, atmospheric transport and effects on human health and the environment of heavy metals, as well as on abatement techniques and costs,
Aware that techniques and management practices are available to reduce air pollution caused by the emissions of heavy metals,
Recognising that countries in the region of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN / ECE) have different economic conditions, and that in certain countries the economies are in transition,
Resolved to take measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise emissions of certain heavy metals and their related compounds, taking into account the application of the precautionary approach, as set forth in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,
Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
Mindful that measures to control emissions of heavy metals would also contribute to the protection of the environment and human health in areas outside the UN / ECE region, including the Arctic and international waters,
Noting that abating the emissions of specific heavy metals may provide additional benefits for the abatement of emissions of other pollutants,
Aware that further and more effective action to control and reduce emissions of certain heavy metals may be needed and that, for example, effects-based studies may provide a basis for further action,

Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air
RECOGNIZING the significant contribution of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules to International Carriage by Air signed in Warsaw on 12 October 1929, hereinafter referred to as the "Warsaw Convention", and other related instruments to the harmonization of private international air law;
RECOGNIZING the need to modernize and consolidate the Warsaw Convention and related instruments;
RECOGNIZING the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution;
REAFFIRMING the desirability of an orderly development of international air transport operations and the smooth flow of passengers, baggage and cargo in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 7 December 1944;
CONVINCED that collective State action for further harmonization and codification of certain rules governing international carriage by air through a new Convention is the most adequate means of achieving an equitable balance of interests,
It applies equally to gratuitous carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.
Carriage between two points within the territory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.
Carriage performed by State and carriage of postal items
(a) an indication of the places of departure and destination;
(b) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place.
(2) Jede andere Aufzeichnung, welche die in Absatz 1 genannten Angaben enthält, kann anstelle des in jenem Absatz genannten Beförderungsscheins verwendet werden. Any other means which preserves the information indicated in paragraph 1 may be substituted for the delivery of the document referred to in that paragraph.
If any such other means is used, the carrier shall offer to deliver to the passenger a written statement of the information so preserved.
If such other means are used, the carrier shall, if so requested by the consignor, deliver to the consignor a cargo receipt permitting identification of the consignment and access to the information contained in the record preserved by such other means.
The air waybill or the cargo receipt shall include:
(a) an indication of the places of departure and destination;
(b) if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a single State Party, one or more agreed stopping places being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least one such stopping place; and
(c) an indication of the weight of the consignment.
The consignor may be required, if necessary, to meet the formalities of customs, police and similar public authorities to deliver a document indicating the nature of the cargo.
This provision creates for the carrier no duty, obligation or liability resulting therefrom.
(1) Der Luftfrachtbrief wird vom Absender in drei Ausfertigungen ausgestellt. The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original parts.
The second part shall be marked "for the consignee"; it shall be signed by the consignor and by the carrier.
The third part shall be signed by the carrier who shall hand it to the consignor after the cargo has been accepted.
(4) Wird der Luftfrachtbrief auf Verlangen des Absenders vom Luftfrachtführer ausgestellt, so wird bis zum Beweis des Gegenteils vermutet, dass der Luftfrachtführer im Namen des Absenders gehandelt hat. If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill, the carrier shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf of the consignor.
(a) the carrier of cargo has the right to require the consignor to make out separate air waybills;
(b) the consignor has the right to require the carrier to deliver separate cargo receipts when the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4 are used.
Non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 4 to 8 shall not affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, nonetheless, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to limitation of liability.
(1) Der Absender ist unter der Bedingung, dass er alle Verpflichtungen aus dem Frachtvertrag erfuellt, berechtigt, über die Güter in der Weise zu verfügen, dass er sie am Abgangs- oder Bestimmungsflughafen sich zurückgeben, unterwegs während einer Landung aufhalten, am Bestimmungsort oder unterwegs an eine andere Person als den ursprünglich bezeichneten Empfänger abliefern oder zum Abgangsflughafen zurückbringen lässt. Subject to its liability to carry out all its obligations under the contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the consignee originally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to the airport of departure.
The consignor must not exercise this right of disposition in such a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and must reimburse any expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right.
(3) Kommt der Luftfrachtführer den Weisungen des Absenders nach, ohne die Vorlage der diesem übergebenen Ausfertigung des Luftfrachtbriefs oder der Empfangsbestätigung über die Güter zu verlangen, so haftet er unbeschadet seines Rückgriffsanspruchs gegen den Absender dem rechtmäßigen Besitzer des Luftfrachtbriefs oder der Empfangsbestätigung über die Güter für den daraus entstehenden Schaden. If the carrier carries out the instructions of the consignor for the disposition of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt delivered to the latter, the carrier will be liable, without prejudice to its right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt.
(4) Das Recht des Absenders erlischt mit dem Zeitpunkt, in dem das Recht des Empfängers nach Artikel 13 entsteht. The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13.
Nevertheless, if the consignee declines to accept the cargo, or cannot be communicated with, the consignor resumes its right of disposition.
(2) Sofern nichts anderes vereinbart ist, hat der Luftfrachtführer dem Empfänger das Eintreffen der Güter unverzüglich anzuzeigen. Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.
(3) Hat der Luftfrachtführer den Verlust der Güter anerkannt oder sind die Güter nach Ablauf von sieben Tagen seit dem Tag, an dem sie hätten eintreffen sollen, nicht eingetroffen, so kann der Empfänger die Rechte aus dem Frachtvertrag gegen den Luftfrachtführer geltend machen. If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived, the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.
The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given to them by Articles 12 and 13, each in its own name, whether it is acting in its own interest or in the interests of another, provided that it carries out the obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.
Relations of consignor and consignee or mutual relations of third parties
Formalities of customs, police or other public authorities
The consignor is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of the carrier, its servants or agents.
Death and injury of passengers - damage to baggage
However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage.
In the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, the carrier is liable if the damage resulted from its fault or that of its servants or agents.
(a) inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo;
(b) defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the carrier or its servants or agents;
(c) an act of war or an armed conflict;
(d) an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry, exit or transit of the cargo.
(3) Die Luftbeförderung im Sinne des Absatzes 1 umfasst den Zeitraum, während dessen die Güter sich in der Obhut des Luftfrachtführers befinden. The carriage by air within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article comprises the period during which the cargo is in the charge of the carrier.
If, however, such carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for the purpose of loading, delivery or transhipment, any damage is presumed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which took place during the carriage by air.
If a carrier, without the consent of the consignor, substitutes carriage by another mode of transport for the whole or part of a carriage intended by the agreement between the parties to be carriage by air, such carriage by another mode of transport is deemed to be within the period of carriage by air.
The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo.
Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.
If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to the damage.
When by reason of death or injury of a passenger compensation is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the extent that it proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of that passenger.
This Article applies to all the liability provisions in this Convention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.
Compensation in case of death or injury of passengers
(a) such damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the carrier or its servants or agents; or
(b) such damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party.
Limits of liability in relation to delay, baggage and cargo
In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the passenger 's actual interest in delivery at destination.
In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the consignor 's actual interest in delivery at destination.
Nevertheless, when the destruction, loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air waybill, or the same receipt or, if they were not issued, by the same record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4, the total weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the limit of liability.
The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.
Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgement.
The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgement, for its operations and transactions.
The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State.
This monetary unit corresponds to 65,5 milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred.
These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round figures.
The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.
(3) Die Berechnung nach Absatz 1 Satz 4 und die Umrechnung nach Absatz 2 ist so vorzunehmen, dass soweit wie möglich die Beträge in den Artikeln 21 und 22 demselben Realwert in der Landeswährung des Vertragsstaats entsprechen, wie er sich aus der Anwendung des Absatzes 1 Sätze 1 bis 3 ergeben würde. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this Article and the conversion method mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles 21 and 22 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1 of this Article.
State Parties shall communicate to the depositary the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2 of this Article as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.
The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the Special Drawing Right mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 23.
(2) Ergibt die in Absatz 1 genannte Überprüfung, dass der Inflationsfaktor 10 Prozent (13) übersteigt, so notifiziert der Depositar (14) den Vertragsstaaten die angepassten Haftungshöchstbeträge. If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Depositary shall notify States Parties of a revision of the limits of liability.
Any such revision shall become effective six months after its notification to the States Parties.
If within three months after its notification to the States Parties a majority of the States Parties register their disapproval, the revision shall not become effective and the Depositary shall refer the matter to a meeting of the States Parties.
The Depositary shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force of any revision.
(3) Unbeschadet des Absatzes 1 ist das in Absatz 2 genannte Verfahren auf Verlangen eines Drittels der Vertragsstaaten jederzeit anzuwenden, wenn der in Absatz 1 genannte Inflationsfaktor seit der vorherigen Überprüfung oder, wenn eine solche nicht erfolgt ist, seit Inkrafttreten des Übereinkommens, 30 Prozent (17) überstiegen hat. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the procedure referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied at any time provided that one-third of the States Parties express a desire to that effect and upon condition that the inflation factor referred to in paragraph 1 has exceeded 30 per cent since the previous revision or since the date of entry into force of this Convention if there has been no previous revision.
Subsequent reviews using the procedure described in paragraph 1 of this Article will take place at five-year intervals starting at the end of the fifth year following the date of the reviews under the present paragraph.
A carrier may stipulate that the contract of carriage shall be subject to higher limits of liability than those provided for in this Convention or to no limits of liability whatsoever.
Any provision tending to relieve the carrier of liability or to fix a lower limit than that which is laid down in this Convention shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Convention.
Nothing contained in this Convention shall prevent the carrier from refusing to enter into any contract of carriage, from waiving any defences available under the Convention, or from laying down conditions which do not conflict with the provisions of this Convention.
In the case of aircraft accidents resulting in death or injury of passengers, the carrier shall, if required by its national law, make advance payments without delay to a natural person or persons who are entitled to claim compensation in order to meet the immediate economic needs of such persons.
Such advance payments shall not constitute a recognition of liability and may be offset against any amounts subsequently paid as damages by the carrier.
In the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights.
In any such action, punitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable.
(1) Nimmt der Empfänger aufgegebenes Reisegepäck oder Güter vorbehaltlos an, so begründet dies die widerlegbare Vermutung, dass sie unbeschädigt und entsprechend dem Beförderungsschein oder den anderen Aufzeichnungen im Sinne des Artikels 3 Absatz 2 und Artikels 4 Absatz 2 abgeliefert worden sind. Receipt by the person entitled to delivery of checked baggage or cargo without complaint is prima facie evidence that the same has been delivered in good condition and in accordance with the document of carriage or with the record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 3 and paragraph 2 of Article 4.
(2) Im Fall einer Beschädigung muss der Empfänger unverzüglich nach Entdeckung des Schadens, bei aufgegebenem Reisegepäck jedenfalls binnen sieben und bei Gütern binnen vierzehn Tagen nach der Annahme, dem Luftfrachtführer Anzeige erstatten. In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest, within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of checked baggage and 14 days from the date of receipt in the case of cargo.
In the case of delay, the complaint must be made at the latest within 21 days from the date on which the baggage or cargo have been placed at his or her disposal.
In the case of the death of the person liable, an action for damages lies in accordance with the terms of this Convention against those legally representing his or her estate.
(1) Die Klage auf Schadenersatz (25) muss im Hoheitsgebiet eines der Vertragsstaaten erhoben werden, und zwar nach Wahl des Klägers entweder bei dem Gericht des Ortes, an dem sich der Wohnsitz des Luftfrachtführers, seine Hauptniederlassung oder seine Geschäftsstelle befindet, durch die der Vertrag geschlossen worden ist, oder bei dem Gericht des Bestimmungsorts. An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of its principal place of business, or where it has a place of business through which the contract has been made or before the court at the place of destination.
(3) Im Sinne des Absatzes 2 bedeutet For the purposes of paragraph 2,
(a) "commercial agreement" means an agreement, other than an agency agreement, made between carriers and relating to the provision of their joint services for carriage of passengers by air;

(1) Bei gemischter Beförderung, die zum Teil durch Luftfahrzeuge, zum Teil durch andere Verkehrsmittel ausgeführt wird, gilt dieses Übereinkommen vorbehaltlich (29) des Artikels 18 Absatz 4 nur für die Luftbeförderung im Sinne des Artikels 1. In the case of combined carriage performed partly by air and partly by any other mode of carriage, the provisions of this Convention shall, subject to paragraph 4 of Article 18, apply only to the carriage by air, provided that the carriage by air falls within the terms of Article 1.
Carriage by air performed by a person other than the contracting carrier
The provisions of this Chapter apply when a person (hereinafter referred to as "the contracting carrier") as a principal makes a contract of carriage governed by this Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor, and another person (hereinafter referred to as "the actual carrier") performs, by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier, the whole or part of the carriage, but is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of this Convention.
Such authority shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.
If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to the contract referred to in Article 39, is governed by this Convention, both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, be subject to the rules of this Convention, the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the contract, the latter solely for the carriage which it performs.
Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual carrier to liability exceeding the amounts referred to in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24.
Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights or defences conferred by this Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery at destination contemplated in Article 22 shall not affect the actual carrier unless agreed to by it.
Any complaint to be made or instruction to be given under this Convention to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting carrier or to the actual carrier.
Nevertheless, instructions referred to in Article 12 shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.
In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if they prove that they acted within the scope of their employment, be entitled to avail themselves of the conditions and limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention to the carrier whose servant or agent they are, unless it is proved that they acted in a manner that prevents the limits of liability from being invoked in accordance with this Convention.
In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment, shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to that person.
In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately.
If the action is brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case.
Any action for damages contemplated in Article 45 must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as provided in Article 33, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier has its domicile or its principal place of business.
Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the actual carrier of liability under this Chapter or to fix a lower limit than that which is applicable according to this Chapter shall be null and void, but the nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract, which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
Except as provided in Article 45, nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the carriers between themselves, including any right of recourse or indemnification.
Any clause contained in the contract of carriage and all special agreements entered into before the damage occurred by which the parties purport to infringe the rules laid down by this Convention, whether by deciding the law to be applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void.
States Parties shall require their carriers to maintain adequate insurance covering their liability under this Convention.
A carrier may be required by the State Party into which it operates to furnish evidence that it maintains adequate insurance covering its liability under this Convention.
The provisions of Articles 3 to 5, 7 and 8 relating to the documentation of carriage shall not apply in the case of carriage performed in extraordinary circumstances outside the normal scope of a carrier 's business.
The expression "days" when used in this Convention means calendar days, not working days.
After 28 May 1999, the Convention shall be open to all States for signature at the Headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal until it enters into force in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Article.
For the purpose of this Convention, a "Regional Economic Integration Organisation" means any organisation which is constituted by sovereign States of a given region which has competence in respect of certain matters governed by this Convention and has been duly authorized to sign and to ratify, accept, approve or accede to this Convention.
A reference to a "State Party" or "States Parties" in this Convention, otherwise than in paragraph 2 of Article 1, paragraph 1 (b) of Article 3, paragraph (b) of Article 5, Articles 23, 33, 46 and paragraph (b) of Article 57, applies equally to a Regional Economic Integration Organisation.

on the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus
Having regard to the desire to promote the development of international transport in Europe and especially to facilitate the organisation and operation thereof,
Having regard to the desire to facilitate tourism and cultural exchange between the Contracting Parties,
The Agreement on the international carriage of passengers by road by means of occasional coach and bus services (ASOR), signed in Dublin on 26 May 1982 does not provide for any scope for the accession of new Parties.
The experience and the liberalisation achieved by this latter Agreement should be maintained.
It is desirable to provide for harmonised liberalisation of certain international occasional services by coach and bus and the transit operations thereof.
It is desirable to provide for certain harmonised rules of procedure for non-liberalised international occasional services, that are thus still subject to authorisation.
It is necessary to provide for a high degree of harmonisation of the technical conditions applying to buses and coaches carrying out international occasional services between Contracting Parties in order to improve road safety and protection of the environment.
It is necessary that Contracting Parties should apply uniform measures concerning the work of the crews of buses and coaches engaged in international road transport.
It is desirable to provide for harmonisation of the conditions for access to the occupation of road passenger transport operator.
The principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality or the place of establishment of the transport operator, and of the origin or destination of the bus or coach, should be considered to be a basic condition applying to the provision of international transport services.
It is necessary to provide for uniform models for transport documents such as the control document for liberalised occasional services and also the authorisation and the application form for non-liberalised services in order to facilitate and simplify inspection procedures.
It is necessary to provide for certain harmonised measures on the enforcement of the Agreement, especially as far as control procedures, penalties and mutual assistance are concerned.
It is appropriate to establish certain procedures for the management of the Agreement in order to ensure proper enforcement and to permit some technical adaptation of the Annexes.
The Agreement should be open for accession to future members of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport and to certain other European countries,
HAVE DECIDED to establish uniform rules for the international occasional carriage of passengers by coach and bus, and
(a) to the international carriage of passengers, of any nationality, by road by means of occasional services:
- between the territories of two Contracting Parties, or starting and finishing on the territory of the same Contracting Party and, should the need arise during such services, in transit through the territory of another Contracting Party or through the territory of a non-Contracting State,
- carried out by transport operators for hire or reward established in a Contracting Party in accordance with its law and holding a licence to undertake carriage by means of international occasional services by coach and bus,
- using buses and coaches registered in the Contracting Party where the transport operator is established;
(b) to unladen journeys of the buses and coaches concerned with these services.
Contracting Parties shall ensure that the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of the nationality or the place of establishment of the transport operator, and of the origin or destination of the bus or coach, is applied, in particular with regard to fiscal provisions as established in section VI, as well as control and penalties as established in section IX.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:
1. "buses and coaches" are vehicles which, by virtue of their construction and their equipment, are suitable for carrying more than nine persons, including the driver, and are intended for that purpose;
2. "international occasional services" are services between the territory of at least two Contracting Parties falling within neither the definition of regular services or special regular services nor the definition of a shuttle service.
Such services may be operated with some degree of frequency without thereby ceasing to be occasional services;
3. "regular services" are services which provide for the carriage of passengers according to a specified frequency and along specified routes, whereby passengers may be taken up or set down at predetermined stopping points.
Regular services can be subject to the obligation to respect previously established timetables and tariffs;
4. "special regular services" are services, by whomsoever organised, which provide for the carriage of specified categories of passengers to the exclusion of other passengers, in so far as such services are operated under the conditions specified in point 3.
- the carriage of workers between home and work,
- the carriage of school pupils and students to and from the educational institution.
The fact that a special regular service may be varied according to the needs of users shall not affect its classification as a regular service;
1. "shuttle services" are services whereby, by means of repeated outward and return journeys, previously formed groups of passengers are carried from a single place of departure to a single destination.
Each group, consisting of the passengers who made the outward journey, shall be carried back to the place of departure on a later journey by the same transport operator.
Place of departure and destination shall mean, respectively, the place where the journey begins and the place where the journey ends, together with, in each case, the surrounding localities within a radius of 50 km;
2. in the course of shuttle services, no passenger may be taken up or set down during the journey;
3. the first return journey and the last outward journey in a series of shuttles shall be made unladen;
4. however, the classification of a transport operation as a shuttle service shall not be affected by the fact that, with the agreement of the competent authorities in the Contracting Party or Parties concerned:
- passengers, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 1, make the return journey with another group or another transport operator,
- passengers, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 2, are taken up or set down along the way,
- the first outward journey and the last return journey of the series of shuttles are, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 3, made unladen;
"Contracting Parties" are those signatories that have consented to be bound by this Agreement and for which this Agreement is in force.
This Agreement applies to those territories where the Treaty establishing the European Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and to BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, BULGARIA, CROATIA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, ESTONIA, HUNGARY, LATVIA, LITHUANIA, MOLDOVA, POLAND, ROMANIA, SLOVAKIA, SLOVENIA and TURKEY, as far as they have concluded this Agreement;
7. "competent authorities" are those authorities designated by the Member States of the Community and by the other Contracting Parties to carry out the tasks set out in sections V, VI, VII, VIII and IX of this Agreement;
8. "transit" means the part of a transport operation through the territory of a Contracting Party without passengers being picked up or set down.
The buses and coaches used to carry out the international occasional services covered by this Agreement shall comply with the technical standards laid down in Annex 2.
The following occasional services shall be exempted from authorisation on the territory of any Contracting Party other than that in which the transport operator is established:
1. closed-door tours, that is to say services whereby the same bus or coach is used to carry the same group of passengers throughout the journey and to bring them back to the place of departure.
The place of departure is in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;
2. services which make the outward journey laden and the return journey unladen.
The place of departure is in the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;
3. services during which the outward journey is made unladen and all the passengers are taken up in the same place, provided that one of the following conditions is met:
(a) passengers constitute groups, on the territory of a non-Contracting Party or of a Contracting Party other than that in which the transport operator is established or that where the passengers are taken up, that have been formed under contracts of carriage made before their arrival in the territory of the latter Contracting Party.
Passengers are carried on the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;
(b) passengers have been previously brought, by the same transport operator in the circumstances provided for under point 2, into the territory of the Contracting Party where they are taken up again and carried into the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established;
(c) passengers have been invited to travel into the territory of another Contracting Party, the cost of transport being borne by the person issuing the invitation.
Such passengers must constitute a homogeneous group, which has not been formed solely with a view to undertaking that particular journey and which is brought into the territory of the Contracting Party in which the transport operator is established.
The following shall also be exempted from authorisation:
4. transit operations through the territory of Contracting Parties in conjunction with occasional services that are exempted from authorisation;
5. unladen buses and coaches to be used exclusively for the replacement of a bus or a coach damaged or broken down, while performing an international service covered by this Agreement.
For services provided by transport operators established within the European Community, the points of departure and / or destination of the services can be in any Member State of the European Community, independently of the Member State in which the bus or coach is registered or the Member State in which the transport operator is established.
The Contracting Parties to this Agreement which have not yet done so shall accede to the European Agreement concerning the work of crews of vehicles engaged in international road transport (AETR) of 1 July 1970, as subsequently amended, or shall apply Community Regulations (EEC) No 3820 / 85 and (EEC) No 3821 / 85 as in force at the entry into force of this Agreement.

Taking into account the circumstances and particular requirements of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, in particular the need to strengthen national capabilities and capacities for the management of chemicals, including transfer of technology, providing financial and technical assistance and promoting cooperation among the Parties,
Noting the specific needs of some countries for information on transit movements,
Recognising that good management practices for chemicals should be promoted in all countries, taking into account, inter alia, the voluntary standards laid down in the International Code of Conduct and the UNEP Code of Ethics on the International Trade in Chemicals,
Desiring to ensure that hazardous chemicals that are exported from their territory are packaged and labelled in a manner that is adequately protective of human health and the environment, consistent with the principles of the Amended London Guidelines and the International Code of Conduct,
Recognising that trade and environmental policies should be mutually supportive with a view to achieving sustainable development,
Emphasising that nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as implying in any way a change in the rights and obligations of a Party under any existing international agreement applying to chemicals in international trade or to environmental protection,
Understanding that the above recital is not intended to create a hierarchy between this Convention and other international agreements,
Determined to protect human health, including the health of consumers and workers, and the environment against potentially harmful impacts from certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade,
The objective of this Convention is to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties.

(c) "severely restricted chemical" means a chemical virtually all use of which within one or more categories has been prohibited by final regulatory action in order to protect human health or the environment, but for which certain specific uses remain allowed.
It includes a chemical that has, for virtually all use, been refused for approval or been withdrawn by industry either from the domestic market or from further consideration in the domestic approval process, and where there is clear evidence that such action has been taken in order to protect human health or the environment;
(d) "severely hazardous pesticide formulation" means a chemical formulated for pesticidal use that produces severe health or environmental effects observable within a short period of time after single or multiple exposure, under conditions of use;
(e) "final regulatory action" means an action taken by a Party, that does not require subsequent regulatory action by that Party, the purpose of which is to ban or severely restrict a chemical;
(f) "export" and "import" mean, in their respective connotations, the movement of a chemical from one Party to another Party, but exclude mere transit operations;
(g) "Party" means a State or regional economic integration organisation that has consented to be bound by this Convention and for which the Convention is in force;

in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia concerning the system of ecopoints to be applied to Croatian transit traffic through Austria as from 1 January 2003
I have the honour to inform you that, following negotiations between the delegation of the Republic of Croatia and the delegation of the European Community, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 (2) (b) of the Protocol 6 to the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia, the following has been agreed:
Additional ecopoints allocated for Croatian users of the Rollenden Landstrasse (RoLa) (up to a maximum of 40% of the total number of ecopoints for 2003): 68762 ecopoints.
Ecopoints for RoLa users shall be allocated to the Croatian authorities, on the basis of ecopoints for two road journeys for every two round trips made on RoLa.
The Austrian companies for combined transport, will regularly provide, each month, information to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications of the Republic of Croatia concerning Croatian users of combined transport in transit through Austria.
Transit journeys made in the circumstances listed in Annex A or under ECMT authorisations shall be exempt from the ecopoints system.
(a) a duly completed standard form or an Austrian certificate confirming payment of the ecopoints for the journey in question, modelled on Annex B, hereinafter referred to as "the ecocard"; or
(b) an electronic device, fitted to the motor vehicle which enables the automatic debiting of ecopoints, hereinafter referred to as "the ecotag"; or
(c) appropriate documentation to demonstrate that an ecopoint-free transit journey, as defined in Annex A or under ECMT authorisation is being made; or
(d) appropriate documentation to demonstrate that a non-transit journey is being made, and when the vehicle is fitted with an ecotag, the ecotag is set for this purpose.
The competent Austrian authorities shall issue the ecocard against payment of the cost of production and distribution of ecopoints and ecocards.
The ecotag shall be programmed to contain information on the country of registration and the NOx value of the motor vehicle, as stated in the conformity of production (COP) document, as defined in point 4.
The ecotag shall be affixed to the windscreen of the motor vehicle.
It shall be positioned in accordance with Annex D. It shall be non-transferable.
Heavy goods vehicles first registered before 1 October 1990 or in respect of which no document is produced shall be assumed to have a COP value of 15,8 g / kWh.
5. Das Ministerium für Seefahrt, Verkehr und Kommunikation der Republik Kroatien ist befugt, die in den Nummern 2 bis 4 angeführten Dokumente und Umweltdatenträger auszugeben. The Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications of the Republic of Croatia is authorised to issue the documents and ecotags referred to in points 2 to 4.
The ecocard shall be cancelled by any one of the following methods:
(a) stamping the ecocard in an ecocard stamping machine;
(b) having the ecocard stamped by the Austrian border control authorities upon entering Austria;
(c) having the ecocard stamped and dated by the national authorities of the haulier before entering Austrian territory;
(d) having the ecocard stamped at an office where the initialisation of ecotags is performed.
Austrian frontier stations that are equipped with an ecocard stamping machine are listed in Annex F.
For statistical purposes page 1 of the completed ecocard shall either be collected by the Austrian authorities or subsequently returned by the competent authorities within three months of the completion of the journey to the Austrian authorities.
The statistics thus collected shall assist the Commission in making any proposal for the distribution of the reserve ecopoints.
If the vehicle is fitted with an ecotag, upon confirmation of its undertaking a transit journey requiring ecopoints, a number of ecopoints, equivalent to the NOx emission information stored in the ecotag of the vehicle, shall be deducted from the total of ecopoints allocated to the Republic of Croatia.
This shall be done by infrastructure provided and operated by the Austrian authorities.
For vehicles fitted with ecotags that are making bilateral journeys they must set the ecotag to demonstrate that a non-transit journey is being made prior to entering Austrian territory.
In the case where an ecocard is used and where a tractor unit is switched during a transit journey, the proof of payment on entry shall remain valid and be retained.
Where the COP value of the new tractor unit exceeds that indicated on the form, additional ecopoints, affixed to a new card, shall be cancelled on leaving the country.
Continuous transit journeys through Austria using the following rail terminals shall be deemed as bilateral journeys:
The Commission and the competent authorities of Austria and Croatia shall, each within the limits of their jurisdiction, provide each other with administrative assistance in investigating and prosecuting these infringements, in particular by ensuring that ecocards and ecotags are correctly used and handled.
Controls may be carried out at a point other than the internal border, at the discretion of the European Community Member State, with due regard to the principle of non-discrimination.
(a) the vehicle or the operator of the vehicle has repeatedly committed infringements;
(b) there are insufficient ecopoints remaining in the allocation of Croatia;
(c) the ecotag has been tampered with or has been changed by a party other than those authorised in point 3;
(d) Croatia has not allocated sufficient ecopoints for the vehicle to make a transit journey;
(e) the vehicle does not have appropriate documentation in accordance with point 2 (c) or (d) to justify why the ecotag has been set to demonstrate that a non-transit journey is being made on Austrian territory;
(f) when the ecotag specified in Annex C is not loaded with sufficient ecopoints to make a transit journey.
The Austrian supervisory authorities may, having due regard to the principle of proportionality, take appropriate measures if a vehicle is not fitted with an ecotag and at least one of the following situations occurs:
(a) an ecocard is not presented to the supervisory authorities in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;
(b) an ecocard is presented which is incomplete or incorrect, or where the ecopoints are not correctly affixed;
(c) the vehicle does not possess the appropriate documentation to justify that it does not need ecopoints;
(d) the ecocard has not been cancelled in accordance with the procedure laid down in point 6.
In such a case the certificate issued by the appropriate authority shall mention the change of engine and give details of the new COP value for NOx emissions.
(a) the sole purpose of the journey is to deliver a brand new vehicle, or vehicle combination, from the manufacturers to a destination in another State;
(b) no goods are transported on the journey;
(c) the vehicle or vehicle combination has appropriate international registration papers and export licence plates.
(a) a bill of lading; or
(b) a completed ecocard to which no ecopoints have been attached; or
(c) a completed ecocard with ecopoints, which are subsequently reinstated.
15. Alle Probleme im Zusammenhang mit der Verwaltung dieses Ökopunktesystems werden dem nach Artikel 41 des Interimsabkommens eingesetzten Interimsunterausschuss Verkehr Gemeinschaft / Republik Kroatien vorgelegt; der Ausschuss bewertet die Situation und empfiehlt geeignete Maßnahmen. Any problems arising from the management of this regime of ecopoints shall be submitted to the Community / the Republic of Croatia Interim Subcommittee on Transport provided for in Article 41 of the Interim Agreement which shall assess the situation and recommend appropriate actions.
Any measure to be taken shall be implemented immediately, shall be proportional and of non-discriminatory nature.

An offence shall also be an extraditable offence if it consists of an attempt or conspiracy to commit, or participation in the commission of, an extraditable offence.
Where the request is for enforcement of the sentence of a person convicted of an extraditable offence, the deprivation of liberty remaining to be served must be at least four months.
(a) regardless of whether the laws in the requesting and requested States place the offence within the same category of offences or describe the offence by the same terminology;

Requests for provisional arrest may be made directly between the Ministries of Justice of the requesting and requested States, as an alternative to the diplomatic channel.
The facilities of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) may also be used to transmit such a request.
Transmission of documents following provisional arrest
In that case, the date of receipt of such request by the Embassy shall be considered to be the date of receipt by the requested State for purposes of applying the time limit that must be met under the applicable extradition treaty to enable the person 's continued detention.

(d) the seriousness of the offences;
(e) the nationality of the victim;
(f) the possibility of any subsequent extradition between the requesting States; and
(g) the chronological order in which the requests were received from the requesting States.

The consent of the person sought may include agreement to waiver of protection of the rule of specialty.
The United States of America may authorise transportation through its territory of a person surrendered to a Member State by a third State, or by a Member State to a third State.

The request shall contain a description of the person being transported and a brief statement of the facts of the case.
A person in transit shall be detained in custody during the period of transit.
If an unscheduled landing does occur, the State in which the unscheduled landing occurs may require a request for transit pursuant to paragraph 2.
All measures necessary to prevent the person from absconding shall be taken until transit is effected, as long as the request for transit is received within 96 hours of the unscheduled landing.
Where the offence for which extradition is sought is punishable by death under the laws in the requesting State and not punishable by death under the laws in the requested State, the requested State may grant extradition on the condition that the death penalty shall not be imposed on the person sought, or if for procedural reasons such condition cannot be complied with by the requesting State, on condition that the death penalty if imposed shall not be carried out.
If the requesting State accepts extradition subject to conditions pursuant to this Article, it shall comply with the conditions.
