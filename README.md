# MSc AI Master Thesis

## Running the program
To run the program, simply run [main.py](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/blob/main/code/main.py) in the [code](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/tree/main/code)-folder.

## Code files
Here's a list of what the different code files do:
- [anonymize.py](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/blob/main/code/anonymize.py) contains all the code needed for anonymization.
- [eval.py](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/blob/main/code/eval.py) currently contains code to evaluate the quality of the anonymization, both by BLEU-score and semantic similarity.
- [util.py](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/blob/main/code/util.py) contains several utility functions that could be useful in any of the other code files.
- [wmtTest.py](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/blob/main/code/wmtTest.py) contains a bit of translation code. Merely used for testing, will be moved to the [old_code](https://github.com/llangeveld/master-thesis/tree/main/code/old_code)-subfolder in time.
